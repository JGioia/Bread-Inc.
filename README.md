# Dig Dug 2 (working title)
This game is based on Stardew Valley. Similar to Stardew Valley, you get tired of the stresses of city life and your job, and you decide to move to a small town to relax. Instead of farming, the main hobby is bread making, also known as breadsmithing. This game takes place in Germany. You just left your old IT job in Munich and moved to Otting, Germany in Bavaria to start a new life. You can make most kinds of bread imaginable. You start out with the simple white bread loaf and progress to the kaiser roll. On weekends you set up your stand and sell bread in the local market. Life isn't all about work though. One of your hobbies is fishing and James, the fishman, is ready to teach you all about fishing. Be sure to interact with the townspeople. Instead of a tavern, like in Stardew Valley, there is a card house. In the card house, you can play classic card games like Texas Hold-Em, Blackjack, and Go Fish! Almost every night there are people at the card house ready to play. However, after a while, you discover not everthing is as it seems...

Gameplay:
- Bread Making. Bread making is a complicated process which most of the game revolves around. You need the right tools, like bowls, sifters and ovens. You need the right ingredients, like flour and sugar. And you need to do things for the right amount of time, like kneeding the bread and letting it rise for the right amount of time. Making a batch of bread takes several hours, so realistically you can only make a few batches per day. You can also set a in game timer, which counts down on the side of your screen. Each type of bread requires a different recipe which you may have to learn.
- Bread Selling. Bread selling is an automatic process that happens on Saturday of every week. You automatically set up shop and start selling bread. The amount that the bread sells for depends on its quality, demand, and bread type. Eventually, once you are making enough bread, you can start exporting it out of town.
- Fishing. Fishing is currently identical to stardew valley's fishing, where you have to click for the right amount of time to keep the fish in the good area. I may add a second dimension to the game, so you have to pull sideways too.
- Card playing. Card playing is pretty self-explanatory. You do everything with buttons. Other people from the town play against you. You can bet real(in-game) or fake money, depending on the day. Each character has different variable values in their AI that affect their aggressiveness in more complicated like poker.
- Character interaction. You can interact with character with right click. They always have something to say and will often be useful (You can learn more about the town and the character or you could learn a bread recipe, if you've been nice to them).
- The twist. is a suprise.
